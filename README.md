# Robotics Manipulation via Monocular Depth Estimation with One-Shot Adaptation

**Authors:** Teng Guo, Baichuan Huang, Jingjin Yu

## Overview

We present a framework for robotic manipulation using **monocular depth estimation (MDE)** with **one-shot adaptation**. Unlike standard MDE models that only provide relative depth, our method aligns predictions to metric scale via a **scale–rotation–shift calibration** using sparse ground-truth depth points.

Tested on a **UR5 robot**, the framework enables reliable **grasping and suction**, even for **transparent objects**, without retraining on each setup.

## Highlights

* Single RGB input, no multi-view needed
* One-shot metric depth alignment
* Fine-tuned on transparent objects
* High success rates on UR5 grasping & suction tasks
